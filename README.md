## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

Copy `dev-config.example.edn` to `dev-config.edn`. 
This file contains config overrides - secrets that generally 
should not go in source control.

If you want to download the Marvel character data you'll need your
own API key which you should add to your `dev-config.edn`
